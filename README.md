#  Profit Predictor

**Introduction**

This project aims to predict the total profit for the next year of Amazon sales data using a machine learning model. The goal is to provide valuable insights for business planning and decision-making.

**Methodology**

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Cleaned and standardized the dataset by handling missing values and outliers.
   - Extracted relevant features: 'Year' and 'Previous3Years'.

2. **Model Selection:**
   - Chose a Random Forest Regressor due to its ability to handle non-linear relationships and its robustness to overfitting.

3. **Hyperparameter Tuning:**
   - Used GridSearchCV to find optimal hyperparameters for the Random Forest model.

4. **Evaluation:**
   - Evaluated the model using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
   - Performed 5-fold cross-validation to assess generalization performance.

**Results**

- Achieved a Mean Absolute Error of [insert MAE value] on the cross-validation set.
- The most important features for prediction were found to be 'Year' and 'Previous3Years'.
- Predicted profit for the next year: [insert predicted profit]

**Conclusion**

The Profit Prediction Model effectively forecasts next year's profit based on historical data. Future work could involve exploring additional features, experimenting with different models, and incorporating time series analysis techniques.

**Usage Instructions**

1. Install required libraries (e.g., pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib).
2. Place the dataset ('AmazonSalesData.csv') in the same directory as the code.
3. Run the Python script.

**Technical Details**

The model uses a Random Forest Regressor with the following hyperparameters (best values found through GridSearchCV):

- n_estimators: [best value]
- max_depth: [best value]
- min_samples_split: [best value]

**Limitations**

The model is based on historical data and may not accurately predict future profits in the face of significant changes in market conditions or unforeseen events.
